h3. 1.2.5 - Alpha

* Refactored sIBL_GUI Logging / Verbose: Now sIBL_GUI and sIBL_Framework use Python Standard Logging. Both are using a Log file : "sIBL_GUI_LogFile.log" for sIBL_GUI and "sIBL_Framework_LogFile.log" for sIBL_Framework. Those files are deleted then created each time the softwares start. One side effect is that if you launch two instances of sIBL_GUI, they will both output Log to "sIBL_GUI_LogFile.log" file, while it will not prevent sIBL_GUI from working, both Logging will be mixed.

* Updated sIBL_GUI Help File - Manual.

h3. 0.9.6 - Alpha

* Bug introduced with Linux Code that prevented remote execution with Maya on Windows.
* Corrected a dangerous behavior introduced with Eclipse NSIS Plugin: It adds this line to the setup script : "RmDir /r /REBOOTOK $INSTDIR". That means that if you installed by mistake at the root of "Program Files/" and not in "Program Files/sIBL_GUI", everything in "Program Files/" will be deleted. sIBL_GUI - 0.9.6 For Windows and 12 October Nightly Releases are concerned !
