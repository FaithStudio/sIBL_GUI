h3. Introduction

sIBL_GUI is a tool making easier the process of importing sIBL files in your Target 3D Package. 
What is sIBL ? It's a short for "Smart IBL". It's a standard describing all informations and files needeed to provide fast and easy Image Based Lighting Setup. 
A lot more informations are available here : "http://www.smartibl.com":http://www.smartibl.com

h3. Concept

Why the need of an external application to load sIBL files into a 3D package and not directly use scripting possibilities of the package itself ? There are advantages and inconvenients in both methods. 
Doing the external application way, all the sIBL parsing, Collection Browsing is handled by sIBL_GUI, you just just have to deal with a simple Loader Script for each 3D package : It took me only a few hours to convert the XSI Template into a Maya one. Rescripting an entire browser with a nice interface would have taken days and I must admit it : I failed to do it for XSI, that's why I decided to build an external application.
